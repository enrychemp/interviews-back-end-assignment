# Backend Engineer Interview Assignment

  

## Introduction

  

This is an interview exercise for the Web & Mobile team of [xtream](https://www.linkedin.com/company/xtream-srl). In the

following sections, you will find a number of challenges that we ask you to implement. You **DO NOT NECESSARILY need to

complete 100% of them**, but rather only the ones you feel comfortable with or that interest you.

  

:watch: We estimate it should take around 8 hours to solve the challenges, and we give you **1 week** to submit a

solution, so that you can do it at your own pace.

  

### Deliverables

  

Simply fork this repository and work on it as if you were working on a real-world project assigned to you. A week from

now, we will checkout your work and evaluate it.

  

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Important**: At the end of this README, you will find a "How to run" section that is not

written out. Please, write there instructions on how to run your code.

  
  

### Evaluation

  

Your work will be assessed according to several criteria. As an example, these include:

  

* Code quality

* Design Patterns

* Project Structure

* Work quality (commits, branches, workflow, tests, ...)

* Provided Documentation

  

#### A Friendly Reminder:

We're all for AI advancements and cool tech (we wouldn't be here otherwise, right?), but let's not outsource our fun to our silicon-based friends! We're really keen on getting to know your approach, your way of thinking and, of course, your wonderful mistakes along the way! So, while we totally get the allure of asking ChatGPT (or its cousins) to whip up a solution, we'd like this party to be strictly humans-only. Remember, it's the quirks, the head-scratching moments, and those glorious "Eureka!" instants that make us love this job. So go ahead, get your hands keyboard-deep in code, and show us what you got! Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’»ðŸš€

  

### Let's get started

  

We do understand that some topics might be unfamiliar for you. Therefore, pick any number of challenges and try to complete them.

  

:heavy_exclamation_mark:

**Important**: you might feel like the tasks are somehow too broad, or the requirements are not

fully elicited. **This is done on purpose**: we want to give you freedom to take your own choices and to put as fewer

constraints as possible on your work. As an example, feel free to choose any technology you like for the database.

### Problem Domain

  

Your task is to build the backend for an application that handles posts, comments, and user interactions. The end goal is to facilitate a timeline that displays posts and their corresponding comments.

  

#### Challenge #1

  

Design a web service that allows to manipulate posts and comments. A post can have a title and a body, while a comment only contains some text. The application needs to provide functionalities to retrieve, create, update, and delete posts and their corresponding comments. Posts and comments must be retrieved and ordered based on their last update date (e.g., the last update date of a post changes whenever a comment is added to it).

  

#### Challenge #2

  

Consider a scenario where the application handles a significantly larger number of posts (~thousands). If necessary, redesign the API to efficiently retrieve them.

  

#### Challenge #3

  

Introduce user management by adding APIs for user signup and login. Also, display user references within posts and comments. When posts and comments are fetched, relevant user info (name, userId, etc.) should be embedded within each entity. Consider providing a functionality to fetch all posts written by a particular user.

  

#### Challenge #4

  

This application is great, and people are using so frequently that the number of posts and comments has grown too much! It's becoming difficult to find a post, and so the frontend team asks you to provide a search API so that a user can write some words inside a searchbar and load all the posts that contain those words. Can you help them?

  

#### Challenge #5

As the number of users and their interactions grow, we need to consider the database design's efficiency. How would you structure a database to handle the posts, comments, and users? Let's see your prowess in database design. Please also write a small paragraph to explain your choices.

  

#### Challenge #6

To ensure our application runs smoothly, we need to identify any potential bugs or issues. The solution? Testing, of course! Could you write some tests for your code to help us prevent potential meltdowns? Also, make sure to let us know how to run these tests. And remember, a good test is worth a thousand debugs!

  
  

## How to run

Questa app utilizza nodejs, yarn, database MongoDB.
Per semplificare lo sviluppo ho utilizzato Docker per rendere disponibile localmente una instanza del DB.
Al momento ho affrontato la challenge #1 e #2
  

### Installazione
#### 1 - Clonare la repo
```
git clone git@github.com:enrychemp/interviews-back-end-assignment.git
```

#### 2 - Installazione
```
yarn run install
```

  

#### 3 - setup
Ãˆ necessario definire un file .env, puoi duplicare e rinominare .env.example
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Nel file .env vanno definite le seguenti variabili
- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=
- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=
- MONGO_DB_APP=


*NB. per il momento non sono stati creati utenti specifici per l'accesso al database, ma usiamo l'utente root per comoditÃ  in fase di svilupppo.*

#### 4 - avviare docker e creazione dei containers
```
docker compose -f "docker-compose-dev.yaml" up -d --build
```


## Avvio server API
```
yarn run dev
```
  

## Avvio seeder
Per default crea 10 post e da 0 a 50 relativi commenti
```
yarn run seed
```
Si possono definire N post da creare ad esempio 150
 ```
yarn run seed posts=150
``` 

## Reset delle collections e nuovo seeder
Resetta le collections posts e comments e avvia un seeder da 100 commenti
```
yarn run seed --reset posts=100
```


## Documentazione API
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1276443/2s9Y5YTP4p


## TODO
- creazione di un commento relativo ad un post
